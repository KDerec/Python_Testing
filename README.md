<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a proof of concept (POC) project to show a light-weight version of our competition booking platform. The aim is the keep things as light as possible, and use feedback from the users to iterate.

The app is powered by [JSON files](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/json/json_quick_guide.htm). This is to get around having a DB until we actually need one. The main ones are:
    
* competitions.json - list of competitions
* clubs.json - list of clubs with relevant information. You can look here to see what email addresses the app will accept for login.
### ðŸŒ± Developped skills
- Analyze application performance with Locust.
- Implement a Python test suite.
- Handle errors and exceptions in Python.
- Debug the code of a Python application.

### ðŸš€ Project goal
Correct the error, the four bugs and add the feature of the issues section [here](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/Python_Testing/issues).  
Create test and performance report.

### Built With

* [Python v3.x+](https://www.python.org/)
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/)
* [Virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation.html)

Before you begin, please ensure you have this installed globally.

## Installation

1. <a href="#python-installation">Install Python</a> ;
2. Clone the project in desired directory ;
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/KDerec/Python_Testing.git
   ```
3. Change directory to project folder ;
   ```sh
   cd path/to/Python_Testing
   ```
4. Create a virtual environnement ;
      ```sh
      virtualenv.
      ```
5. Activate the virtual environment ;
    * For Windows :
      ```sh
      Scripts\activate
      ```
    * For Linux :
      ```sh
      source bin/activate
      ```
6. Install package of requirements.txt ;
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
7. Flask requires that you set an environmental variable to the python file. However you do that, you'll want to set the file to be `server.py`.  
   Check [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#a-minimal-application) for more details

8. You should now be ready to test the application. In the directory, type either <code>flask run</code> or <code>python -m flask run</code>. The app should respond with an address you should be able to go to using your browser.

#### Python installation

1. Install Python. If you are using Linux or macOS, it should be available on your system already. If you are a Windows user, you can get an installer from the Python homepage and follow the instructions to install it:
   - Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
   - Under the Download section, click the link for Python "3.xxx".
   - At the bottom of the page, click the Windows Installer link to download the installer file.
   - When it has downloaded, run it.
   - On the first installer page, make sure you check the "Add Python 3.xxx to PATH" checkbox.
   - Click Install, then click Close when the installation has finished.

2. Open your command prompt (Windows) / terminal (macOS/ Linux). To check if Python is installed, enter the following command (this should return a version number.):
   ``` sh
   python -V
   # If the above fails, try:
   python3 -V
   # Or, if the "py" command is available, try:
   py -V
   ```
